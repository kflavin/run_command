Increment version number in run_command/__init__.py

Python egg:
------------
To build python egg, run: python setup.py bdist

RPM
------------
bdst_rpm doesn't seem to build the RPM properly with requirements.  As a
workaround, you can do this.

First, run: python setup.py bdist_rpm
Note that the package under dist/ *doesn't* work

Go to the SPEC file: build/bdist.linux-x86_64/rpm/SPECS/run_command.spec

Add the following lines:

Requires: python-setuptools
Requires: python-pip
Requires: python-argparse

Then from build/bdist.linux-x86_64/rpm, run the following (be sure the _topdir
property is set, or rpmbuild won't know where to look):
rpmbuild -ba --define "_topdir /root/automation/run_command/build/bdist.linux-x86_64/rpm" SPECS/run_command.spec

The RPM should build, and you should be able to find it under:
/root/automation/run_command/build/bdist.linux-x86_64/rpm/RPMS/noarch
